      <h1>Outcome 4 Reflection</h1>
      <div>
        <p>Through the course of ENGL 131, I’ve demonstrated my mastery in outcome 4. </p>
        <p>Outcome 4 is defined in our terms as the ability to receive feedback from audiences, peers, and oneself, as well as the ability to implement it. </p>
        <br /><br />
        <p>Major Project 1 is by far the best example of these skills. My project was a photo essay detailing my experiences with conservation and parks over time. </p>
        <p>While creating outlines for our projects, we had peer feedback sessions, where we communicated with each other about our projects, and what we thought other people did well/what they could think about implementing. </p>
        <p>During our peer feedback sessions, some of the most valuable feedback isn’t any of the nitty-gritty grammatical or formatting issues, it is the nature of your project; it is the feedback related to how you use different modes, and whether you’re using them to their full potential. </p>
        <p>For example, I got feedback based on how I could place the text next to the photos to associate the text with the photos, which I ended up implementing. </p>
        <br /><br />
        <p>I also demonstrated my revision skills when revising Part 2 of my Major Project 1, which is an essay describing the purpose of my project and what decisions I made to achieve that purpose. </p>
        <p>After getting feedback from Prof. Peters, I read over it and considered whether each change she proposed would line up with my purpose and improve my text. </p>
        <p>In most cases, this was true, so I read over all the comments and found common points in the feedback. In this case, it was primarily related to my organization and use of evidence, so I reviewed my paper with these points in mind while paying extra attention to the specific points with comments. </p>
        <p>As a result, I ended up with a better paper that feels easier and better to read! </p>
        <br /><br />
        <p>Thus, ENGL 131 exercised my skills in revising texts. Revision is an incredibly important skill in every field: the ability to improve upon your writing and to get feedback from a new set of eyes will always lead to higher-quality work. </p>
        <p>To conclude, I can now say that I’ve mastered Outcome 4! </p>
